While race is a social construct, racism is very real, and has created biological realities for race (e.g., poorer outcomes for African Americans re: COVID-19). In the very same sense, gender is a social construct that has biological outcomes. I know this and I see this. But please do not confuse sex and gender. Sex is a biological reality. Yes, there's variation, but the history of oppressing the female sex has been, in large part, to their biological differences from men. Creating sex as a political class, and the history of feminist efforts, have long fought to gain some ground on this issue. Obscuring the differences between sex and gender really does threaten to limit the fights of sex-based oppression. No other political class, besides women, have been asked to change the language and identity of their class to make room for another. I truly want to fight for trans rights, but I also want to be able to call myself a woman and a mother and to fight for women's rights (abortion, domestic violence awareness, fertility awareness, access to menstrual products) without being told I'm being exclusionary. Ignoring biological sex differences, such as the fact that females (for the most part) have certain biological needs and are oppressed because of it, is akin, in my opinion, to colorblindess. We HAVE to see sex, and see the reasons women want to organize as a political class, without being told what they have to call themselves (menstruators, people with uteruses, cisgendered female, etc) while also being told that they have to honor other people in what they want to be called. I don't want to be called a cisgendered female. I am an adult female, a woman. As a society we are finally coming around to the idea that you can't just claim an identity (you can't claim to be Black or Native American because you have a certain genetic makeup), and yet some are telling women that they are women, too. I think we really need to have an open conversation about this, without being labeled as transphobic.
